# Contributing to Gemini Bridge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gemini Bridge! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to work with you.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [Gemini CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/gemini-cli) installed and authenticated
- Git for version control
- A GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-bridge.git
   cd gemini-bridge
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   
   # Verify installation
   python -m src --help
   ```

4. **Verify Gemini CLI is working**:
   ```bash
   gemini --version
   gemini auth login  # if not already authenticated
   ```

5. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Test the MCP server directly
   python -m src
   
   # Test integration with Claude Code (if available)
   ./start_server_dev.sh
   ```

3. **Follow code style guidelines** (see below)
4. **Update documentation** if needed

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- **Imports**: Group imports logically (standard library, third-party, local)
- **Docstrings**: Use clear, descriptive docstrings for functions and classes
- **Type hints**: Include type hints for function parameters and return values

### Example code style:
```python
from typing import Optional, List
import subprocess
import json

def consult_gemini(
    query: str, 
    directory: str = ".", 
    model: Optional[str] = None
) -> str:
    """
    Send a query to Gemini CLI.
    
    Args:
        query: The question or prompt to send
        directory: Working directory for the query
        model: Optional model name (flash, pro)
        
    Returns:
        Gemini's response as a string
        
    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If CLI is not available or query fails
    """
    # Implementation here...
```
